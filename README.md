Here is demostrating a little bit of how after we installed os ticket we were able to assign roles to the agents in the departmeant. We made sure to properly assign the correct roles such as admin and restricted certain functions based on the user.

Basic user configuration to allow user in the organizations to be able to submit tickets. I gave them a username and password from there these users would submit serveral tickets where later I would assign to the correct SLA and team to respond.
